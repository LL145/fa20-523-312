## <ins>Research Statement:</ins>
When it comes to revolutionizing our qualities of life and improving standards, there is not another branch of science and technology that has made more impact than the myriad technological capabilities offered by the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its sub-fields involving Computer Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, etc. It should be borne in mind that AI was developed to allow machines/computer processors to work in the same way as the human brain works and which could make intelligent decisions at every conscious level. It was meant to help with tasks for rendering our workplaces even better and make applications even smarter and more efficient. There are many tasks that can be performed in a far more dexterous fashion by employing smart-machines and algorithms than by involving human beings. Robotic surgical operation, for treating critical ailments or removing tumorous formations (which require an insurmountably meticulous level of precision), is one such example. 

But even more importantly, AI has also been designed to perform tasks that cannot be successfully completed by employing human beings. This could either be due to the prolonged boredom of the task itself, or a task that involves hazardous environments that cannot sustain life-forms for a long time. Some examples in this regard would involve exploring deep mines or volcanic trenches for mineral deposits, exploring the vast expanse of the universe and heavenly bodies, etc. And this is where the concept employing AI/Robotics based technology fits in perfectly for oceanographical applications.
 
As Dr. Gene Feldman suggests, it is indeed a fact that we have explored more regions of planetary sites than the remotest parts of the vast oceanic system of our own planet. Exploration of ocean, or any other marine ecosystem for that matter, could give us a treasure trove of information regarding biodiversity, mineral deposits, unknown biophysical phenomenon, and most importantly, information related to the biodegradation of the ecosystem itself. As part of this fellowship program and the author’s MS Thesis endeavor, an attempt will be made to design a basic and preliminary foundation of an aquatic autonomous surface vehicle that will be deployed in marine ecosystems with different kind of electronic sensors, and which would be capable of measuring physical quantities (viz. temperature, pH, conductance, dissolved oxygen level, etc.) that could give us an idea about the status of the aquatic degradation of the ecosystem in question. With the help of my lead thesis advisor (Dr. Maria Bondesson), and the Cheng Wu Innovation Fellowship – Summer 2020 program and its mentor (Dr. Travis Brown), a preliminary foundational work was completed during the Summer 2020 semester, which will go through further enhancements and upgradation during the upcoming Fall semester.
